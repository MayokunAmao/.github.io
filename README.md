# Project 1

**Title:** [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Q1 2025)](https://github.com/MayokunAmao/.github.io/blob/main/Mtncustomerchurn.pbix)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Power BI (Data Modelling, DAX, Interactive Visuals, Slicers)

**Project Description:** This project analysed customer churn data for MTN Nigeria to uncover patterns, causes, and opportunities for customer retention in Q1 2025. An interactive dashboard was developed to provide stakeholders with a detailed view of churn behaviour, helping to design effective customer retention strategies and optimize revenue.

The dashboard includes the following features:

•	Total Revenue and Revenue Lost: Display of total revenue generated and revenue lost due to churn.

•	Customer Churn and Retention Metrics: Breakdown of total customers, churned customers, and retained customers.

•	Churn Reasons Analysis: Visualization of top reasons for customer churn.

•	Churn Rate by Subscription Plan: Analysis of churn rate across different subscription plans.

•	Churn by Age Group: Insights into churn trends across various customer age demographics.

•	Churned Customers’ Tenure: Distribution of customer lifespan before churn (in months).

•	Churned Customers by State: Geographic distribution of churned customers across Nigerian states.

•	Average Data Usage Analysis: Comparison of data usage between churned and retained customers.

•	Churn by Gender: Gender-based churn statistics.

Interactive Filters Include:

•	Gender

•	Device Type

•	Age Group

•	State

**Key Findings:**

•	Top Churn Drivers: High data costs and better offers elsewhere were the leading causes of customer churn.

•	Age Group Impact: Customers aged 56+ accounted for the highest proportion of churn at 36.62%.

•	Churn by Subscription Plan: Higher churn rates were observed in plans offering larger data bundles (e.g., 200GB, 3.2GB).

•	Tenure Insights: Many customers churned within short tenure periods, highlighting issues with early-stage customer retention.

•	Regional Insights: Abuja, Imo, and Kebbi recorded the highest churn volumes.

•	Gender Impact: Churn was slightly higher among females (52.8%) compared to males (47.2%).

**Dashboard Overview:**

#  Project 2

**Title:** [Global Tuberculosis Trends and Health Indicators Dashboard](https://github.com/MayokunAmao/.github.io/blob/main/Tuberculosis.pbix)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Data Preparation), Power BI (DAX Measures, Interactive Visualizations, Slicers)

**Project Description:**

This project analyzed global tuberculosis (TB) data across countries, regions, and income levels to uncover health performance patterns and disease trends over time. An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to provide public health stakeholders with a clear overview of TB-related cases, deaths, incidence rates, treatment success rates, and other key health indicators.

The dashboard empowers decision-makers with real-time insights to support strategic healthcare interventions and policy planning.

The dashboard includes the following features:
•	Total TB Cases and Deaths Overview: KPI cards summarizing the global burden of tuberculosis, enabling a quick assessment of key metrics.

•	TB Incidence, Mortality, and Treatment Success Trends: Line charts showing how TB cases, deaths, incidence rates, and treatment success rates have evolved year over year.

•	Top 10 Countries by TB Deaths and Drug-Resistant TB Cases: Bar charts highlighting countries with the highest TB impact, assisting in identifying priority intervention areas.

•	Health Factors vs Mortality Rate: A scatter plot analyzing the relationship between health expenditure per capita and TB mortality rates, offering insights into the influence of healthcare investment.

Interactive filters include:

•	Region

•	Income Level

•	Country

•	Year

**Key Findings:**
•	Regional Disparities: Certain regions, especially lower-income areas, consistently exhibited higher TB incidence and mortality rates. Treatment Success Insights: A clear relationship was observed between higher access to healthcare services and better treatment success rates. Health System Correlation: Higher national health expenditure per capita was generally associated with lower TB mortality, underscoring the importance of robust healthcare systems. Emergence of Drug-Resistant TB: Some countries showed a growing number of drug-resistant TB cases, highlighting critical areas needing intensified focus.

**Dashboard Overview:**

![tuberculosis2](tuberculosis2.png)The dashboard delivers comprehensive and actionable insights into the global fight against tuberculosis. It equips healthcare leaders, researchers, and policymakers with the information needed to monitor TB trends, allocate resources efficiently, and support evidence-based policy and healthcare planning.
