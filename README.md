•	Customer Churn and Retention Metrics: Breakdown of total customers, churned customers, and retained customers.

•	Churn Reasons Analysis: Visualization of top reasons for customer churn.

•	Churn Rate by Subscription Plan: Analysis of churn rate across different subscription plans.

•	Churn by Age Group: Insights into churn trends across various customer age demographics.

•	Churned Customers’ Tenure: Distribution of customer lifespan before churn (in months).

•	Churned Customers by State: Geographic distribution of churned customers across Nigerian states.

•	Average Data Usage Analysis: Comparison of data usage between churned and retained customers.

•	Churn by Gender: Gender-based churn statistics.

Interactive Filters Include:
•	Gender

**Key Findings:**
•	Top Churn Drivers: High data costs and better offers elsewhere were the leading causes of customer churn.

•	Age Group Impact: Customers aged 56+ accounted for the highest proportion of churn at 36.62%.

•	Churn by Subscription Plan: Higher churn rates were observed in plans offering larger data bundles (e.g., 200GB, 3.2GB).

•	Tenure Insights: Many customers churned within short tenure periods, highlighting issues with early-stage customer retention.

•	Regional Insights: Abuja, Imo, and Kebbi recorded the highest churn volumes.

•	Gender Impact: Churn was slightly higher among females (52.8%) compared to males (47.2%).
